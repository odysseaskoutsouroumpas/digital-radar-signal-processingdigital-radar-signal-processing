# Lab 1 â€“ Basic Signal Generation

This repository contains Python implementations of basic discrete-time signals commonly used in Digital Signal Processing (DSP), along with their visualizations.

## Contents

## Python Scripts:

- `unit_step_ramp.py`: Creates and visualizes the unit step signal (u[n]) and the ramp signal (r[n]).
- `triangle_wave_generation.py`: Generates a triangle wave with adjustable parameters.
- `vector_math_plotting.py`: Generates plots for the vector representation of signals.

### .png Files:
- Visualizations of the above signals, generated from the Python scripts.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

To run the scripts, make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- `numpy` â€“ for numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` â€“ for plotting and visualizing the signals.

To install the necessary libraries, run:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
